<div class="about-text">
	<p>We represent the creative individuals who desire for a space where they feel their tastes and ideas are understood. We are for those who seek not only a place to consume, but to feel welcomed and be inspired by both the atmosphere and the people that inhabit it. We are for those who crave for more than just a “Hello-Goodbye” experience but rather want to feel like they are part of something more. The space aims to act as a collective meeting ground for the creators, innovators, and dreamers of the city to come through and be with people who share the same mindset as each other. </p>
