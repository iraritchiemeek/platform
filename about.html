	<p>We represent the creative individuals who desire for a space where they feel their tastes and ideas are understood. We are for those who seek not only a place to consume, but to feel welcomed and be inspired by both the atmosphere and the people that inhabit it. We are for those who crave for more than just a “Hello-Goodbye” experience but rather want to feel like they are part of something more. The space aims to act as a collective meeting ground for the creators, innovators, and dreamers of the city to come through and be with people who share the same mindset as each other. </p>
	<p>Welcome to PLATFORM: A concept store founded by Cyrus Chow and Molawin Evangelista.</p>
	<p>The name “PLATFORM” comes from our desire to be able to showcase the creations of different makers and creatives in a unique medium and setting. The products and labels we have curated for the store all represent in some way, shape or form what it means to create an object that is not only a result of minimal, functional and well-thought design, but offers longevity and represents craftsmanship. With this ethos in mind, we have incorporated this design language into the atmosphere of the PLATFORM store front by making a non-intrusive, clean and functional space for visitors to relax and browse.</p>
	<p>We hope you enjoy your stay at PLATFORM.</p>
	<p>C & M.</p>
